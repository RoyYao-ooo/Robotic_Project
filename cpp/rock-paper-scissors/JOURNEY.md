## ðŸš€ My First C++ Adventure: A Developer's Journey
> date: 2025 Jul 29

< This project is more than just a gameâ€”it's a milestone in my first few days of learning C++. As a Mechanical Engineering student with a background in Python and MATLAB, my journey into **Robotics** felt like it was missing a key piece. I realized that to truly command the machines of the future, C++ was non-negotiable. >

For me, Python is the **"brain"**â€”crafting high-level strategyâ€”while C++ is the **"nervous system,"** delivering lightning-fast, precise commands to the hardware. This project is my first real step into building those nerves.

Honestly, I'm amazed at how fast this has all come together. It's an incredible feeling and proves that all those hours spent on my NumPy course last semester really paid off by building a solid programming foundation. This project wasn't just about writing code; it was a gauntlet of classic C++ challenges, and I feel like I've leveled up by conquering them.

## ðŸ’¡ Lessons Unlocked

Throughout this project, I battled several "beginner bosses," and each victory deepened my understanding of programming:

* **Taming the Build System:** The `Undefined symbol: _main` linker error in VS Code was a major hurdle. I eventually learned that the problem wasn't just with the code itself (like a missing `return 0;`), but more critically, with taming the build configuration (`tasks.json`) and ensuring the compiler was correctly instructed to find and link all necessary files.

* **The Rules of C++ Grammar:** I learned the "declare before use" rule for functions and mastered how to use **Function Prototypes** to create more flexible and organized code structures.

* **Mapping the Code's World:** Through implementing the scoring system, I came to understand the fundamental difference in **Scope** between **global and local variable scope**.

> The real trophy here isn't the finished game. It's the skill of **systematic debugging**. Going from staring blankly at an error message to methodically hunting down the bug is the most valuable power-up I've gained. The thrill of seeing it all finally click into place after a tough battle is what makes this journey so addictive.
